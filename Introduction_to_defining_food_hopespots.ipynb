    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to guide the reader through the process of creating the Rurban food hopespots model, developed as part of Lancaster University's Rurban Revolution project (https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/rurbanrevolution/), in the open source QGIS. The methodology that underpins this is the Hopespots model that was developed by Geofutures in collaboration with Friends of the Earth to identify opportunities for planting trees in Bristol and Bath's greenbelt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic GIS skills are required to follow this methdology so to support those users unfamiliar with GIS, we have create a 'How To' video which is can be found at ....\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic model structure\n",
    "The model comprises three basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The definition of the candidate locations that have the potential for food production across the district, with particular focus on the peri-urban areas;\n",
    "\n",
    "* The definition of the constraints on the potential for food production, such as nature reserves and areas prone to flooding; and\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The evaluation of the candidate locations in the context of the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An open source approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The HopeSpots approach is based on the methodology developed by Geofutures for Friends of the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this guide, we will assume that the reader has access to QGIS, an open source GIS available at: http://www.qgis.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the examples given in this guide are derived from open source datasets, although it is extensible and private datasets can also be used to augment the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Licences** for the open source datasets used in this project can be found in the Licences document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map data for this project, which are focused on Lancaster District and its environs, can be found in the directory ./data/processed and are in shapefile format and component files are zipped. Specific datasets are referred to in the text below in the following way *(Shapefile - data/processed/initial_model_parameters/rurban_study_extent.zip)*\n"

    "# 2. Initial model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the model, it necessary to set up a couple of key parameters for the QGIS - namely the map projection to be used, and also defining the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the map projection\n",
    "\n",
    "The default map projection used is British National Grid (BNG) since many of the input open source data files are provided under from the Ordnance Survey (OS) and other from UK Government sources which often (but not always) provide geographical data projected in BNG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data supplied in other projections can be readily re-projected within QGIS and exported files can be similarly re-projected (for example in WGS 84 or similar that are used in online mapping, for example Google Maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the study area\n",
    "The purpose of defining a study area is to specify the geographical frame within which the analysis will be undertaken. For the RURBAN Hopespots project, the area of interest is the City of Lancaster local authority area. *(Shapefile - data/processed/initial_model_parameters/Lancaster_district.zip)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to mitigate edge effects, and to facilitate the application of a range of modelling techniques (such as raster modelling) a Minimum Enclosing Rectangle (MER) is defined around the spatial extent of the district and then snapped to the nearest 1,000 metres out-with the MER.  *(Shapefile - data/processed/initial_model_parameters/rurban_study_extent.zip)*\n",

    "# 3. Defining Candidate locations\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage of the modelling process is to define the locations within the district where food growing is possible according to a combination of different, broadly defined, criteria. These locations are known as candidate locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Rurban project we have identified 3 potential data sources to combine to produce the map of potential candidate locations. The first two are open source data sources, while the third points to another non open source option from the City of Lancaster local authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not the only datasets that could be possibly used for defining candidate location and we hope that other sources to be identified by contributors to this repository in due course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, all the datasets used in the model can be found in /data/processed. The extent of all the datasets have been clipped using *data/processed/initial_model_parameters/rurban_study_extent.zip*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agricultural land classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) is a dataset sourced from Natural England via data.gov.uk under an Open Government Licence and identifies Agricultural Land in England. A similar dataset is also available for Wales from https://gov.wales/agricultural-land-classification; and for Scotland, as the Land Capability for Agriculture, Scotland (at data.gov.uk). As far as we are aware, there is not a similar dataset available in Northern Ireland.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALC classifies agricultural land into 5 grades from 1 (best) to 5 (poorest). It also has a classification for urban areas. In the Rurban Food Hopespots methodology we identified grades 1-4 as having ready potential for food production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the City of Lancaster local authority area, the ALC recorded no grade 1 agricultural land and so our analysis is based on the locations of grades 2,3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Shapefile - data/processed/candidate_locations/agricultural_land_234_lancaster_district.zip)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordnance Survey Greenspace data\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with the ALC is that is does not identify the potential for food production within urban areas. For this we turn to the the Ordnance Survey's Open Greenspace dataset, also available under an Open Government Licence at https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-greenspace .\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset maps public parks, allotments, playing fields and play spaces, sports facilities including golf courses. It does not generally map parcels of greenspace that are undeveloped (for example greenspace between buildings, or small plots of open ground which may be communally accessible. And so from a food production perspective, may not be fully sufficiently comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, some of the greenspaces identified in the Ordnance Survey dataset may not be suitable for food production (such as golf courses, for example) but we have decided nonetheless to include them in this prototype model for explanatory purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Shapefile - data/processed/candidate_locations/OS_Greenspace_Lancaster_District.zip)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Authority datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, local authorities will have collated their own greenspace datasets for local policy purposes and these can be used to augment the total space allocated for potential food growing within urban areas, no t least since they may capture land parcels not collected by the Ordnance Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prototype project, we did augment our candidate locations with data made available by The City of Lancaster, but due to licensing issues, we are unable to make these available in this repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "So while the only data for candidate locations based on the Agricultural Land Classification and Ordnance Survey Greenspace data are shared in *data/processed/candidate_locations*, we nonetheless will share images of the other datasets where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crowd sourced datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "There may also be an opportunity to include data from other sources, such as those collected via internet map services like open street map or by community food initiatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have not identified any for application in this prototype project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining the data to identify food growing locations across the district\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to combine the potential food growing locations in the district, we use the QGIS _Union_ function, found in the toolbar menu under **VECTOR->Geoprocessing Tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![QGIS Union Interface function](./images/QGIS_union_function.png \"Combining the datasets\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this union of these datasets is complex since the attribute fields associated with both datasets are preserved in the combined output *(Shapefile: data/processed/candidate_locations combined_food_growing_candidate_locations.zip)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the peri urban areas and completing the candidate locations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rurban project is specifically interested in the potential of food production in the peri-urban areas of the district which we have defined as a 20 minute walking distance (about 1.6 km or approximately a mile) rom the main urban areas of the district.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of urban areas is never straightforward but we used the open sourced ONS built up area polygons (dated December 2011) available under Open Government Licence from https://data.gov.uk/dataset/15e3be7f-66ed-416c-b0f2-241e87668642/ to identify the main urban centres within our study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having selected the main urban centres within the City of Lancaster *(Shapefile -  data/processed/defining_the_peri_urban_areas/ons_main_settlements.zip)* we then used the buffer function of QGIS from the menu **VECTOR->Geoprocessing Tools** to define a 1600 metre buffer around this major settlements *(Shapefile - data/processed/defining_the_peri_urban_areas/lancaster_peri_urban_areas_1600m.zip)* and then using the QGIS clip function **VECTOR->Geoprocessing Tools** - to identify peri-urban candidate locations and thereby create our final candidate location dataset to further analyse in the next phase of the process:\n",

    "# 4. Identifying the constraints on food production\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have identified a large number of candidate locations for food growing in the peri urban areas of the City of Lancaster, we have to acknowledge that some of these may not be that suitable for food production when we look at them in more detail, not least because the Agricultural Land Classification paints with a broad brush, and does not account for potential restrictions on agricultures, such as nature reserves, very steep land, or land prone to flooding.\n",
